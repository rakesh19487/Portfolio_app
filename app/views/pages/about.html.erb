<h1 class="cover-heading">About me</h1>
<p class="lead"> With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.
